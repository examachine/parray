Parallel_Arrays is a C++ class library for data-parallel arrays in C++.
The parallelization is achieved through MPI-2 calls. The focus
of the library is data-parallel array computation reminiscient
of HPF directly in C++ syntax.

The library also functions as a sequential array library similar
in design to Blitz++ and Pooma. The array expressions are handled
using expression templates, which is used to avoid temporaries.
The library supports fundamental element-wise and reduction
operations, as well as a simple array I/O facility. The library
internally uses parallel iterator classes to define array-scale
operations and generic functions use these iterators to achieve
decoupling of container and algorithm modules as in standard C++
library.

Data distribution is specified directly by user, and simple
distribution schemes are already present in the library. All messaging
is hidden from the user, as the library aims at comprehensible
syntax.
